## Some Initial Challenges

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


1. Load the Guinea Pigs dataset (`data/pigs.csv`)
    + Contains odontoblast (tooth) length in guinea pigs
    + Vitamin C via direct supplement or OJ
    + Three doses (Low, Med, High)
2. Create a boxplot of length separating groups by dose & supp
3. Find the mean odontoblast length for each dose & supplement method
4. Include the standard deviation alongside the mean
5. Create a barplot showing mean length with error bars

(We'll learn how to set the dose categories in order tomorrow)


## Loading and Manipulating Data

1. Find which sheets are in the file "data/NERP_Fauna_Survey_Protocols_Field_Trial_2015_Data_v1.xlsx" ^[Obtained from https://portal.tern.org.au/results?topicTerm=surveillance]

2. Load the main data sheet from this file using `read_excel()` from `readxl`

3. How would you compare measurements for the species across different sites
    + Try using tables
    + How can you visualise this?
