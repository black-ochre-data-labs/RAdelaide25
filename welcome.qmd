# Introduction {background-color="#3d3d40"}

## Welcome to RAdelaide 25

We wish to acknowledge the Kaurna people as the traditional custodians and owners of this beautiful country, and that the land was never ceded.

::: {.fragment}

We acknowledge the strong and ancient connections to country and pay our respects to Kaurna elders, past, present and emerging

:::
::: {.fragment}
Especially in NAIDOC week, we also pay our respects to all Aboriginal Australians and acknowledge those who are with us today.

## Today's Tutors

- Jimmy Breen, Holly Massacci & Liza Kretzschmar (Black Ochre Data Labs)
- John Salamon & Simon Lee (SAGC)
- Charlotte Sai (SAHMRI)

## Who Are The Attendees

::: {.notes}
- We had 3 SPSS users & 2 Stata Users so please feel free to stop me and ask questions about processes yo may already be familiar with in other statistical languages
- 5 python programmers end even some with LaTex/markdown
- Very surprised to see someone with Perl experience. The language of old-school bioinformatics!
:::

- What are your areas of research and how are you intending to use R?

::: {.incremental}
- Who's never used R before?
- Who's dabbled in R?
- Some experience but aware of weaknesses
- Who thinks they can run some sessions next year?
- Has anyone run R scripts on an HPC?
:::


## Housekeeping

- Toilets are back near the lifts
- Catering will be across the lawn in Merantau
    + Rose is in charge of all things catering!
- Room 4.50 is considered a wet lab $\implies$ *no drinks (including water)*


::: {.notes}
Thanks to everyone for sending your information through regarding dietary needs and existing knowledge
:::
    
## Homepage and Material

::: {.notes}
Please ask questions in the channel. 
Tutors will be monitoring as well and can stop so we can address the question as a group
:::

- The workshop homepage is http://blackochrelabs.au/RAdelaide25
    - Data and course material available here
    + Will stay live *in perpetuity*
- Links to notes available
    + Slides are directly re-formatted as a simple webpage
    + Slides are visible by clicking `RevealJS` below the TOC (top-right)
- Group communication can be done through https://bioinformaticshubsa.slack.com/
    + Join the #radelaide25 channel
    


## Course Aims

- Provide a deep understanding of how to work with data in R
    + Importing and Visualising Data
    + Understanding R Data Structures
    + Most common analytic methods and strategies
    
::: {.incremental}

- Enable use of modern analytic approaches [$\implies$ reproducible research]{.fragment .fade-in}
- Provide you with all the building blocks you need
    + Not just *how* [$\implies$ a deep understanding of underlying structures]{.fragment .fade-in}
- The more code you type the more you learn
:::

::: {.notes}
The last point is key. 
Please practice exactly like you're learning a new skill (driving, playing piano, speaking French etc)
:::

## Course Outline

::: {.notes}
- Day 1 may be hard & fast but please stop me & ask questions
- Day 2 is more a "what the hell did we do yesterday" day
- Day 3 should be a real joining the dots day
- We'll cover about as much as is realistic in 3 days
:::

- Today we will explore spreadsheet-like data structures
    + Will be a pretty exhausting day
    + Basic data wrangling and visualisation
    
::: {.fragment}

- Day 2: Developing a more careful, nuanced understanding
    + How does R actually see data
    + Learn the basics of statistical analysis in R

:::
::: {.fragment}
    
- Day 3: Bring everything together and run complete analyses 
    + Preparing complete analytic reports with beautiful figures
    + Analytic techniques beyond t-tests and linear regression

:::

## Future Courses

- No true bioinformatics in this year's course $\implies$ the basics in R
- Teaming up with Cathal King (SAGC) to present back-to-back transcriptomics workshops (September 23-24)
    + Day1: Bulk transcriptomics
    + Day2: Single Cell transcriptomics
    
::: {.incremental}
- The bioinformaticshubsa slack workspace is the best place to stay in touch with upcoming events
- Dr Jacqueline Rehn runs monthly drop-in sessions for new bioinformaticians
:::

## A Comment on AI

- AI engines such as ChatGPT have changed the game completely
- You can ask them to write code for you
    + They will regularly get it wrong
- If I ask ChatGPT to write code for me $\rightarrow$ mine is usually better[<br> and **correct**]{.fragment}

. . .

- Can be a helpful addition to your skill set
    + Especially if your foundations in a language are strong
    
## A Comment on AI

- I do use ChatGPT or Claude.ai to help me write code
    + I ask for help in less familiar languages (e.g. C, python)
    + I ask it to help me write documentation or comment code
    + I often have it running as a "co-pilot"
    + Some examples in RAdelaide25 were inspired by ideas from AI engines
    
::: {.fragment}

- Github CoPilot is free for academic users
    + Worth exploring but you will need a github account
    
:::
    
::: {.notes}
- Running in Co-Pilot mode can be stupidly frustrating as it just keeps making suggestions relentlessly
- I often asked things like "What's a great dataset for demonstrating logistic regression?"
- Most of the tutors will have experience with AI so please chat to us in the breaks
