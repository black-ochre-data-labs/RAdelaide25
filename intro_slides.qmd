:::


## A Comment on AI

- AI engines such as ChatGPT have changed the game completely
- You can ask them to write code for you
    + They will sometimes get it wrong
    + *You will not understand how to use R*
- If I ask ChatGPT to write code for me $\rightarrow$ mine is usually better[<br> and **correct**]{.fragment}
    
## A Comment on AI

- I do regularly use ChatGPT or Claude.ai to help me write code
    + I ask for help in less familiar languages (e.g. C, python)
    + I ask it to help me write documentation or comment code
    + I often have it running as a "co-pilot"
    + Some examples in RAdelaide25 were inspired by ideas from AI engines
    
. . .

- Github CoPilot is free for academic users
    + Worth exploring but you will need a github account
    
::: {.notes}
- Running in Co-Pilot mode can be stupidly frustrating as it just keeps making suggestions relentlessly

# A Brief Introduction to R {background-color="#3d3d40" background-image=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/R_logo.svg/512px-R_logo.svg.png background-size="40%" background-opacity="0.5" background-position='80% 50%'}


## Why use R?

- Heavily used for analysis of biological data (along with Python)
    - Can handle extremely large datasets  
    - Packages explicitly designed for complex analysis
    - Huge user base $\implies$ internet resources
    - (Can be) very fast
- Very easy to *dynamically interact* with large datasets
    - Can also run as static scripts on HPC clusters
    - Low-level languages like `C`/`C++` don't allow for interactive analysis
    
::: {.notes}
I regularly work with data containing millions of lines
:::

## How do we use R?

- Never use drop-down menus or buttons $\implies$ type every command
    - Complex processes are often implemented as 'simple' functions
- Considered a *high-level* language
    - Usually easy to read and understand then low-level languages (e.g. `C`)
    - Trade-off in regard to speed & memory management

## How do we use R?
    
- **Reproducible Research!!!**
    - Keep records (i.e. scripts) of every step of every analysis
    - Transparent methods for reviewers
    
. . .

- Avoids common Excel pitfalls [(almost) never modify files on disk!]{.fragment}

. . .

Experience is the best teacher $\implies$ please practice your skills

::: {.notes}
- Discuss column sorting with Simon although I believe it's improved
- Mention paper claiming GLMs, but absolutely did not fit GLMs
:::

## What is R?

- Derivative of `S` [Bell Labs, @Chambers1977-ry]

::: {.fragment}
![](assets/chambers.png)
:::

    
## What is R?

- Derivative of `S` [Bell Labs, @Chambers1977-ry]
- `R` began to appear in 1996 [@Ihaka1996-zi]
    - **R**oss Ihaka and **R**obert Gentleman (U of Auckland)
    - Disentangled some proprietary `S` code $\implies$ *open-source*
- First official release (v1.0.0) in Feb 2000
    - Now estimated >2 million users (2012)
    - Nice history article [here](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2020/RJ-2020-028/RJ-2020-028.pdf) [@Chambers2020-tc]

::: {.notes}
- Ross Ihaka is of NZ Maori descent
- Last commercial release of S-Plus in 2007
- I first found R in 2002, which was v1.5
:::    
    
## What is R?

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width='75%'}

- Open source language
    + No corporate ownership $\implies$ free software
    + Code is managed by the community of users
- `R` is formally run by volunteers $\implies$ **R Core**
    + Mostly academics
    + John Chambers is *still* a member
- Annual release schedule + patches 
    + Most recent is R 4.5.1 (Jun 14)
::::

:::: {.column width='25%'}

::::

:::

::: {.notes}
- Being open source creates headaches for University & Business IT departments
- There are identified security risks
- No guarantees of being virus free. Has inherent security flaws particularly using R data files (which are often part of packages)
- The community self-regulates
- Release Names are references to Peanuts cartoons
:::
    
## R Packages

- Packages are the key to R's flexibility and power
    - Collections (or libraries) of *related functions*
    - `ggplot2` $\implies$ Create plots using the *grammar of graphics*
    - `readr` $\implies$ Read files into `R`
    
## R Packages  
    
- $>$ 22,000 packages are stored on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org)
    - Not curated for statistical quality or documentation
    - Automated testing for successful installation

. . .

- Bioconductor is a secondary repository (https://www.bioconductor.org)
    - $>$ 2,300 packages with a more biological/genomics focus
    - Curated for language consistency & documentation
    
::: {.notes}
- The gg in ggplot2 stands for "Grammar of Graphics"
- Crap packages are generally identified by the users and then just not-used
- Statistical rigour is usually checked during review of the accompanying publication
:::
   
## Where is R used? {visibility="hidden"}

- Google, ATO, ABS etc
- Very large community of users in finance (Dirk Eddelbuettel - `Rcpp`)
- Genomics, Ecological Research, Public Health, Politics...
- Strong integration with HPC systems like Amazon, Hadoop
- Growing Machine Learning capacity
- Even has it's own peer-reviewed Journal (The R Journal)


::: {.notes}
- I was offered a position by the ABS in 2022 specifically for my R skills to use analysing the housing market.
- BODL offered me a position the exact same day so I stayed in academia

# Using R {background-color="#3d3d40" background-image=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/R_logo.svg/512px-R_logo.svg.png background-size="40%" background-opacity="0.5" background-position='70% 50%'}

## The R Console

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}

- Let's try using `R` as a standalone tool $\implies$ open `R` NOT `RStudio`
    + On `linux`: <br>Open a terminal then enter `R`
    + OSX: Click ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/R_logo.svg/512px-R_logo.svg.png){width="40px"} on your dock
    + Windows: Click ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/R_logo.svg/512px-R_logo.svg.png){width="40px"} in your Start Menu
    
    
- Do not open ![](assets/RStudio_icon.png){width="60px"} 
- This is `R` at it's ugliest (how I learned R)

:::
::: {.column width="45%"}

::: {.fragment}

![](assets/RTerminal.png){.absolute right=0 width="550px"}

:::

:::

::::

::: {.notes}
- This is the 'ugly, old-school' way of using R
- Still very useful, e.g. testing code on a HPC
:::

## The R Console

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}

- This is often referred to as the `R Console` 
- At it's simplest `R` is just a calculator (Press Enter)

```{r}
#| prompt: true
1 + 1
2 * 2
2 ^ 3
```

::: {.fragment}

- `R` has many standard functions
    + place the value *inside* the brackets *after* the function name

```{r}
#| prompt: true
sqrt(2)
log10(1000)
```


::: 

:::

::: {.notes}
I never use a calculator program on my laptop, always R
:::

## The R Console

We can create objects with names

```{r}
#| prompt: true
x <- 5
```

. . .

- We have just created an object called `x`
- The `<-` symbol is like an arrow i.e. "put the value `5` into `x`"

. . .

![*An APL Keyboard from the 1970s showing the arrow as a single key*](assets/APL-keybd2.png){width=60% fig-align="left"}

::: {.notes}
Object names can be anything but should start with a letter not a number or special character
:::


## The R Console

- View the contents of the object by entering it's name in the `Console`

```{r}
#| prompt: true
x
```


- The object `x` only exists in the `R Environment`

. . .

- Imagine your R Environment to be like an Excel Workbook
    + Each object is named just like each spreadsheet is named
    + But objects **don't have to look like a spreadsheet**

. . .

- We can save R Environments but usually don't
    + Save the code instead!

## The R Console

- We can pass objects to functions and perform operations on them

```{r}
#| prompt: true
x + 1
sqrt(x)
x^2
x > 1
```

## The R Console

- Everything we've just done is trivial
- Real analysis isn't
- If we perform a series of steps
    + Should we keep a copy of what we've done?
    + If so, how should we do that?
    

## Recording Our R History


- Try using your up and down arrow keys in the `R Console`
- This will scroll through the history of commands you've entered
    + Can re-execute or modify any of these
- Saved in a file called `.Rhistory` in your working directory

. . .

- A common strategy is to record our code as an *R Script* as we write it
    + Just a plain text file with a record of our commands
- `R Studio` makes that easy & convenient


# R Studio { background-color="#3d3d40" background-image="assets/RStudio_icon.png" background-size="25%" background-opacity="0.5" background-position="50% 50%"}

## Introduction to RStudio

`R` and `RStudio` are **two separate but connected things**

- `R` is like the engine of your car
    
. . .

- `RStudio` is the 'cabin' we use to control the engine
    + Comes with extra features un-related to `R` that improve our 'journey'
    + Known as an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
    
. . .

- `R` *does all the calculations, manages the data, generates plots*
    + i.e. gets us to our destination
    
. . .

- `RStudio` *helps manage our code, display the plots etc*
    + i.e. makes our journey easier to navigate


## What is RStudio {visibility="hidden"}

- RStudio is product of a **for profit** company (Posit)
    + RStudio (Desktop) is free
    + RStudio Server (Posit Workbench) has annual licence fee of \$'000s
- Posit employs many of the best & brightest package developers
    + e.g. `tidyverse`, `bookdown`, `reticulate`, `roxygen2` etc.
    + The CEO (JJ Allaire) is still an active developer
- Other IDEs also exist (e.g. emacs, VSCode, Cursor, Positron)

::: {.notes}
- RStudio/Posit is a corporation whilst R is an academic-led volunteer community. So far relatively good relationship
- Heard JJ Allaire present some of his latest work at a conference in 2023
:::

## Some very helpful features of `RStudio`

- We can write scripts and **execute code** interactively
- Predictive auto-completion 
- We can see **everything** we need (directories, plots, code, history etc.)

. . .

- Use `R Projects` to manage each analysis
- Integration with other languages
    + markdown, $\LaTeX$, bash, python, C++, git etc.
- Numerous add-ons to simplify larger tasks

. . .

- Posit is now developing Positron to better enable a variety of languages


## Important Setup 

1. Create a directory on your computer for today's material
    + We recommend `RAdelaide25` in your home directory

. . .
    
2. Now open `RStudio`
    + `RStudio` will always open in a directory somewhere
    + Look in the `Files` pane (bottom-right) to see where it's looking
    + This is the current working directory for `R`

. . . 

We want RStudio to be looking in our new directory (`RAdelaide25`) <br>$\implies$R Projects make this easy


## Create an R Project

(Not needed for any using the Posit cloud)

`File` > `New Project` > `Existing Directory` <br>

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='left', out.width='35%'}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/RProject.png")
```


- Browse to your `RAdelaide25` directory $\implies$ `Create Project`

## Create an R Project

- The `R Project` name is **always** the directory name
- Not essential, but *good practice* and *extremely useful*
- The Project Menu is in the **top-right** of RStudio

::: {.notes}

- `R Projects` are simply a wrapper for keeping an analysis organised
    - Will always open in the R Project directory
    - You can easily navigate to a directory with all scripts and data
    - Makes managing file paths from your code **very simple**
- R Projects can be particularly helpful when loading external files
- Also when saving/exporting lots of files as part of your analysis
:::


## Create An Empty R Script

1. `File` > `New File` > `R Script`
2. Save As `DataExploration.R`

## RStudio

```{r, echo = FALSE, include=TRUE, results='asis', fig.show='asis', out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/RStudio.png")
```

This is the basic layout we often work with

::: {.notes}
We'll come back to the script window in the next section
:::

## The R Console

- This is the R Console *within* the RStudio IDE
- We've already explored this briefly

. . .

- In the same pane we also have two other tabs
    + **Terminal**: An approximation of a `bash` terminal (or PowerShell for Windows)
    + **Background Jobs** shows progress when compiling RMarkdown & Quarto <br>Not super relevant


## The R Console

As well as performing simple calculations:

- `R` has what we call an `Environment` (i.e. a Workspace)
- We can define objects here or import data
   - Similar to a workbook in Excel with multiple worksheets
   - **Much more** flexible & powerful
   - Objects aren't forced to be spreadsheets
   
::: {.notes}
- When we create a new sheet in Excel, we're actually creating an object.
- Most commonly, it's named Sheet1 or something similar
- Has fixed dimensions for memory management
:::



## The R Environment 

Like we did earlier, in the R Console type:

```{r}
#| prompt: true
x <- 5
```

. . .

*__Where have we created the object `x`?__*

- Is it on your hard drive somewhere?
- Is it in a file somewhere?

. . .

- We have placed `x` in our `R Environment`
- Formally known as your `Global Environment`

![](assets/EnvironmentTab.png)


## The R Environment

- The `R Environment` is like your desktop
- We keep all our relevant objects here 
    + Multiple objects are usually created during an analysis
    + Can save all the objects in your environment as a single `.RData` object
    + `R` can be set to automatically save your environment on exit
    + Unlike Excel: *We usually save our code not our environment*

## The **History** Tab

- Next to the Environment Tab is the **History** Tab
- Keeps a record of the last ~200 lines of code
    + Very useful for remembering steps during exploration
    + Best practice is to enter + execute code from the Script Window
    
. . .

- We can generally ignore the **Connections** and any other tabs
    + A `git` tab will also appear for those who use git in their project


## Accessing Help

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#| prompt: true
?sqrt
```

- This will take you to the `Help` Tab for the `sqrt()` function
    + Contents may look confusing at this point but will become clearer
    
. . .    
    
- Many inbuilt functions are organised into a package called `base`
    - Packages group similar/related functions together
    - `base` is always installed and loaded with `R`
<!-- - Click on the underlined word `Index` at the bottom for a list of functions in the `base` packages -->
<!--    + **Absolutely no need to learn any of these** -->
    
::: {.notes}
- May be issues with `URL '/help/library/base/html/00Index.html' not found`
- The examples in this help page are a bit rubbish...
:::

## Additional Sources For Help

- Help pages in `R` can be hit & miss
    + Some are excellent and informative $\implies$ some aren't
    + I regularly read my own help pages
    
. . .
    
- Bioconductor has a support forum for Bioconductor packages
    + All packages have a vignette (again varying quality)
    
. . .

- Google is your friend [$\implies$ maybe ChatGPT?]{.fragment .fade-in}
    


::: {.notes}
As a package author, I'm always reading my own help pages.
I simply can't remember everything I've written
:::

## The **Plots** Pane

- We've already seen the **Files** Tab
- Plots appear in the **Plots** Tab

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#| prompt: true
plot(cars)
```

## Other Panes

- The **Packages** Tab is *a bad idea*
    + Can be disabled by popular request (I always do)
    + Temptation to click is strong
    + Very bad for **reproducible research**!!!

. . .

- **Viewer** Tab is used when compiling HTML documents from RMarkdown

. . .

- Every tab can be minimised/maximised using the buttons on the top right
- Window separators can be be moved to resize panes manually

## Cheatsheet and Shortcuts

`Help > Cheatsheets > RStudio IDE Cheat Sheet`

Page 2 has lots of hints:

- `Ctrl + 1` places focus on the Script Window
- `Ctrl + 2` places focus on the Console
- `Ctrl + 3` places focus on the Help Tab
    
## Conclusion

- RStudio brings together multiple features for easy coding
- Can easily access Help, Plots, Scripts etc
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
